"""Integration tests that require a real, running Modal container.

The fake-backed suites already cover the harness-owned logic: timeout quantization,
the output ring buffer, path resolution math, and exception mapping. This live tier
admits only regressions a correctly written fake could not catch: real process
execution, infra-enforced deadlines, one filesystem shared by Modal's file API and
the shell, create-time environment and workdir propagation, and real lifecycle
state in Modal's control plane.

Admission rule:
  A test belongs here only when its docstring can name the fake-encoded assumption
  it validates against real Modal behavior.

Portability:
  These assert durable sandbox behaviors, not Modal-specific spellings, so if the Modal
  mechanism is later swapped for a different backend the suite retargets rather than gets
  rewritten:
  * TestRealExecution: the exec call and its result fields rename; a timeout is checked via the
    backend's raised timeout error carrying the pre-kill output, not the `-1` sentinel.
  * TestCreateConfiguration: create-time `env` and `workdir` assertions move to the backend's
    sandbox-configuration surface.
  * TestRealFilesystem: byte file operations move to the backend's file API; the relative-path
    case becomes explicit resolution against the working directory.
  * TestRealLifecycle: dead-sandbox checks become the backend's typed not-found error, and
    attach/reuse maps to its attach surface.

Gating:
  * `modal_live` marker: CI can select this tier with `-m modal_live`; the normal suite can deselect it.
  * skipped unless `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` are set, or `~/.modal.toml` exists.
  * a module-scoped `anyio_backend` fixture keeps the shared Modal handle on one asyncio loop.
